# Simple Bullet Joural App

## Description

Simple one page application for keeping track of tasks, events, and ideas based on the bullet journal style of note taking. Start at the Rapid Log page and add any tasks, events, or ideas you dont want to forget. Categorize your tasks as urgent/important, and set dates for any events. The rapid log is where you enter all your notes for the day will be logged.

The monthly view displays all the events for the selected month along with unfinished tasks for the current month and monthly goals.

The Task List keeps track of everything you have to do and filters tasks into quadrants based on their urgent/important categorization. Click on "Show Completed" to see all the things you checked off you list!

The Thouggts page is where you can expand on ideas, make reading list, or jot down future app iterations.

You can edit the title of a note or delete it on any page, and you can also mark a task as complete by slicking on the bullet any where it shows up.

## Roadmap

Future updates will include:

- Add due dates to taks and they will automatically enter the "Do" quadrant a day before its due.
- Yearly view with goal management.
- Additional edit functinality: urgent/important edit, date edit, etc.
