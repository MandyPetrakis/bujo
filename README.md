# Simple Bullet Joural App

## Description

Simple one page application for keeping track of tasks, events, and ideas based on the bullet journal style of note taking. Start at the Rapid Log page and add any thoughts (!), events (O), or tasks (-) you dont want to forget. The page automatically uses standard bullet journal keys to differentiate your notes.

The rapid log is where you enter all your thoughts and events that come up during the day. The monthly view displays all the events for the selected month. Your Task List keeps track of everything you have to do, as you complete your work click on the task to mark as finished! Lastly, the ideas page lets you expand on your thoughts and save deeper reflections when youre ready.

## Roadmap

Future updates will include:

- the ability to add due dates to tasks
- the daily view will show todays tasks, events, as well as un dated tasks
- the option to generate a random idea note that you may have forgotten about to sparl creativity
